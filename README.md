In this assignment, you'll use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice. To finish this task, you must call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of your site.

Click on one of the topic buttons to see those gif's then click on a gif to animate that gif and click on it again to reret the gif to still.

Type in the text box to create your own gif button then click on that button to see the gifs appear.
